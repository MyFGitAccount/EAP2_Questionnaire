Of course. Here is the revision of each sub-question in the requested format: first stating the original, then the identified problem, and finally the improved version.

---

**1. Original Sub-Question:**
*What is students’ current subscription behaviour (types/categories used, number of active subscriptions, and estimated monthly spending)?*

**Problem Identified (from your comment):**
This is a **behavioural question** aiming for objective facts (number, spending). Such data is challenging to measure accurately and objectively via self-reporting (e.g., surveys, interviews), as students may forget, estimate incorrectly, or be unwilling to share precise financial details. It mismatches with a perception-based study.

**Improved Version (Focusing on Perceived Behaviour/Self-Report):**
*How do HKU SPACE CC students **self-report** their engagement with paid online subscriptions in terms of the categories they use, their **perceived** number of active subscriptions, and their **estimated** monthly spending?*

---

**2. Original Sub-Question:**
*What are HKU SPACE CC students’ habits and patterns regarding paid online subscriptions?*

**Problem Identified (from your comment):**
Similar to the first, this seeks to describe **objective habits and patterns**, which is a behavioural inquiry. Accurately capturing "patterns" requires longitudinal or observational data, which is difficult to obtain. It should be reframed to explore **perceptions of their own habits**.

**Improved Version (Focusing on Perceived Habits):**
*How do HKU SPACE CC students **describe their own habits and patterns** in managing paid online subscriptions, such as the frequency of use, routine checks for value, or cycles of signing up and cancelling?*

---

**3. Original Sub-Question:**
*What are the main motivations for subscribing (e.g., convenience, entertainment, academic needs, ad-free experience, exclusive content), and which factors [motivations?] matter most?*

**Problem Identified (from your comment):**
The phrasing is slightly broad. To align with a perception study, it should explicitly ask students to **evaluate the importance** of these motivations from their perspective.

**Improved Version (Focusing on Perceived Importance):**
*How important do HKU SPACE CC students **perceive** various motivational factors (e.g., convenience, academic needs, ad-free experience, exclusive content) to be in their decision to subscribe to online services?*

---

**4. Original Sub-Question:**
*What factors do HKU SPACE CC students believe motivate them to pay for online subscriptions, and how do they evaluate whether a subscription is “worth it”?*

**Problem Identified:**
This is actually two questions combined. The second part ("how do they evaluate...") is strong and distinct. The first part overlaps significantly with the previous question on motivations.

**Improved Version (Splitting and Sharpening):**
*What criteria do HKU SPACE CC students **believe** they use to evaluate whether a paid online subscription is "worth it" or represents value for money?*

---

**5. Original Sub-Question:**
*What considerations do HKU SPACE CC students believe are most influential when deciding to cancel (or keep) a paid online subscription?*

**Problem Identified:**
This is a well-structured perception-based question. It only needs minor tightening for academic tone.

**Improved Version (Minor Improvement):**
*What considerations do HKU SPACE CC students **perceive** as the most influential when deciding whether to cancel or retain a paid online subscription?*

---

**6. Original Sub-Question:**
*To what extent do students perceive subscriptions as “value for money”, and how does this relate to their intention to renew?*

**Problem Identified:**
This is a good, perception-focused question that explores a relationship. It can be made slightly more precise.

**Improved Version (More Precise):**
*What is the relationship between HKU SPACE CC students' **perception** of a subscription's value for money and their **stated** intention to renew it?*

---

**7. Original Sub-Question:**
*How do pricing transparency and cancellation flexibility influence students’ trust and cancellation/renewal decisions?*

**Problem Identified:**
The phrase "influence... decisions" leans slightly towards causal behaviour. For a perception study, we should frame it as how students **perceive** the impact of these factors.

**Improved Version (Focusing on Perceived Influence):**
*How do HKU SPACE CC students **perceive** the roles of pricing transparency and cancellation flexibility in shaping their trust in a service and their decisions to cancel or renew?*

---

**8. Original Sub-Question:**
*What disadvantages do students experience (e.g., rising total cost, content fragmentation, hidden fees, difficult cancellation, lack of ownership), and what strategies do they use to overcome this disadvantage (e.g., sharing, rotating subscriptions, using free tiers)?*

**Problem Identified (from your comment):**
The first part ("experience") can be misinterpreted as asking for behavioural facts. The second part ("strategies... use") is also behavioural. Both should be framed as **perceptions of significance** and **awareness of strategies**.

**Improved Version (Focusing on Perceived Significance & Awareness):**
1.  *How significant do HKU SPACE CC students **perceive** common disadvantages of subscriptions (e.g., rising total cost, difficult cancellation, lack of ownership) to be?*
2.  *What strategies for managing subscriptions (e.g., account sharing, subscription cycling) are HKU SPACE CC students **aware of or perceive** as legitimate and effective?*

---

**9. Original Sub-Question:**
*What is students’ overall attitude toward the wider “subscription economy” (more products/services shifting to subscriptions), and what is their future willingness to pay?*

**Problem Identified (from your comment):**
The term "subscription economy" is jargon that needs to be clearly defined for participants. "Future willingness to pay" is a behavioural intention, which is acceptable, but the link to the broader trend should be clearer.

**Improved Version (Defining the Concept):**
*What are HKU SPACE CC students' overall attitudes (e.g., acceptance, resignation, resistance) toward the broader trend of services shifting to subscription-based models (the "subscription economy")? How do these attitudes shape their **stated** willingness to adopt new subscriptions in the future?*

---

**10. Original Sub-Question:**
*How do HKU SPACE CC students perceive the broader trend of products and services shifting from one-time purchases to subscription-based models, and what drives these perceptions?*

**Problem Identified:**
This is very similar to 9 and overlaps. The strength here is the explicit ask about *what drives* the perceptions.

**Improved Version (Merging Strength with 9):**
*What are the key drivers (e.g., perceived value, sense of control, financial pressure) that shape HKU SPACE CC students' **perceptions** of the trend toward subscription-based models over one-time purchases?*
